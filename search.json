The modeling work is being guided through a series of stakeholder workshops and engagement with an expert Steering Committee.\nSee the Project Overview for more description of SSEEP, learn about the Project Team, and the year 1 Stakeholder Workshops."

    "text": "Project Organization\nSSEEP is a collaboration between University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Fishery Applications Consuling Team. Funding for the UMass Dartmouth SMAST project PI and staff is supported by a NOAA NEFSC award to the Cooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region (CINAR). The Project Team is supported by a Steering Committee, and through continued engagement with additional partners at NOAA FIsheries as well as stakeholders representing wind and fishery science, management, and industry (see stakeholder workshop section for more information on SSEEP engagement).\n\n\nBackground\nWhen considering multiple use management effects on fisheries (e.g., from infrastructure siting for other marine use sectors), there is a need to not only understand space use effects, but also how impacts to monitoring from spatial changes propagate through to scientific uncertainty in fisheries governance. Changes to the availability of fishery habitat to both fishery independent surveys and fishery dependent data may influence uncertainty associated with data that are key input to stock assessments that provide catch advice. Under current fisheries governance, this increased uncertainty in stock status estimation may result in more precautionary scientific advice (lower quotas) as managers attempt to mitigate risk. Quantifying the effects of this uncertainty in scientific monitoring for fisheries performance is a critical step in understanding system effects of multiple ocean uses, and will help quantify the value and costs associated with alternative monitoring required to mitigate this uncertainty to sustain integrity of data streams for fisheries assessment and management.\nPlanned offshore wind development in the Northeast US and Mid-Atlantic overlaps extensively with the NMFS Bottom Trawl Survey footprints, which have been conducted annually since the 1960s and form the basis of fishery independent data used in stock assessments for commercial and recreationally important fisheries. Based on reviews by BOEM and NMFS, it is likely that bottom trawling will not be able to take place near wind sites, meaning a reduction in resource survey footprints which will interact non-randomly with species distribution and/or life history. Without changes to survey design or consideration of the effects of these changes to the survey footprint, and the evaluation of supplemental monitoring, these changes will diminish the accuracy and representativeness of data the surveys produce and consequently the accuracy downstream of stock assessment models and stock status determinations.\nSSEEP will conduct a series of stakeholder workshops to guide development of a spatial observation simulation model for the Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey that is capable of evaluating the efficacy and statistical properties of changes to survey design and also assess the performance of alternative methods for monitoring groundfish distribution, abundance, and trends. The simulator will be applied to evaluate expected changes in survey data products that will result from spatial reductions in scientific survey coverage due to proposed wind energy installations along the US East Coast, and to assess the efficacy of supplemental monitoring efforts.\n\n\nSSEEP Objectives\n(1) Conduct and facilitate stakeholder workshops aimed at understanding the questions most of interest for the simulation exercise to answer, including the alternatives for survey design and statistical performance measures, and to define a list of scenarios for the mechanisms underlying change (species productivity, distribution) that will form the focus of simulation evaluation.\n(2) Synthesize and perform statistical analyses of the Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey and spatial overlap with wind areas to parameterize an observation model.\n(3) Develop and parameterize a spatially explicit model simulator framework that is capable of emulating observational data from the Northeast Bottom Trawl Surveys and supplemental monitoring methods for a key set of groundfish species\n(4) Conduct simulation testing to evaluate the statistical performance of a stakeholder-based set of plausible alternatives for survey design given a set of ecosystem scenarios and quantify their resulting uncertainty on key data streams used in fishery stock assessment\n\n\nProject Timeline\nYear 1 (2021-2022)\n\nStakeholder workshops to identify research questions and scenarios for simulation evaluations\nSynthesis and statistical analysis of Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey data and spatial overlap with wind areas to parameterize an observation model\nDevelop a spatially explicit model simulator framework capable of emulating observational data from the Northeast Bottom Trawl Surveys and supplemental monitoring methods (continued in year 2)\n\nYear 2 (2022 -2023)\n\nParameterize simulator framework for key set of managed fish species\nSimulation testing to evaluate performance of plausible alternatives for survey design given a set of ecosystem scenarios\nQuantify resulting uncertainty on key data streams used in fishery stock assessment\n\n\n\nAnticipated Project Outcomes\n\nPaths forward for changes to monitoring strategies and their likely consequences in terms of maintaining monitoring data integrity\nRelative ranking for prioritizing changes to survey designs and strategies based on the expected changes for different scenarios and statistical performance\nDescription of desired statistical properties for supplemental sampling strategies to mitigate displacement of bottom trawl survey from wind farm areas, to inform potential new monitoring approaches (e.g., what sorts of data, what level of sampling effort and precision)\nGood enough practices and methods for integrating different sampling methods with heterogeneous environmental surveys that are associated with different spatial processes\nWhich expected scenarios (species, or species distribution drivers) might be most likely to be at risk\nLikely implications of changes to survey sampling for scientific advice (e.g., relative impact on uncertainty in assessments), that can be quantified using Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE).\n\nWhile the initial implementation will be focused on groundfish in the Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey, the model framework developed for this project will be written in an open, general approach such that it can be applied to other instances of multiple ocean use management/overlap, and also in different geographies. The project will also provide training in quantitative fisheries science and collaborative/participatory model building to graduate students and early career scientific staff at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth."

    "text": "_quarto.yml\nLet’s have a closer look at the _quarto.yml file.\nThis type of file (.yml or .yaml) is written in YAML (“Yet Another Markup Language”). You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example. As you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar)."
