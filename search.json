    "text": "The Survey Simulation Experimentation and Evaluation Project (SSEEP) will use a participatory design approach to develop and apply a simulation modeling framework to quantify the potential impacts to the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) bottom trawl surveys and data products resulting from offshore wind development. The simulation will be built to evaluate how these impacts can be mitigated to maintain high quality data and information to support fisheries and ecosystem decision-making. The modeling work is being guided through a series of stakeholder workshops and engagement with an expert Steering Committee.\nBegun in 2021, SSEEP is a Cooperative Institute of the North Atlantic Region (CINAR) funded, multi-institutional partnership project led by Dr. Gavin Fay at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology (UMassD-SMAST) as part of a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) interagency agreement to develop a strategy for mitigating the effects of offshore wind energy development on NOAA Fisheries scientific surveys.\nFor more information on the project, you can visit the Project Overview section and learn about the Project Team, or the Stakeholder Workshops section."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nPlanned offshore wind development is a space use case where spatial changes have the potential to impact the availability of fishery habitat to fishery-independent survey data. In the Northeast US and Mid-Atlantic, the planned development areas overlap extensively with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Bottom Trawl Survey footprints, which have been conducted annually since the 1960s and form the basis of fishery-independent data used in stock assessments for commercially- and recreationally-important fisheries. Based on reviews by BOEM and NMFS, it is likely that bottom trawling will not be able to take place near wind sites, thereby reducing resource survey footprints and forcing non-random interactions of the survey with species’ distribution and/or life history. Without changes to survey design, consideration of the effects of wind area development to the survey footprint, and the evaluation of supplemental monitoring, the impending survey footprint reduction will diminish the accuracy and representativeness of data that the surveys produce as well as the accuracy of stock assessment models and stock status estimations downstream.\nSSEEP will conduct a series of stakeholder workshops in a participatory approach to guide development of a spatial observation simulation model for the NMFS Bottom Trawl Survey. The simulator will be able to evaluate the efficacy and statistical properties of changes to survey design, assess the efficacy and performance of alternative and/or supplemental methods for monitoring groundfish distribution, abundance, and trends, and evaluate expected changes to survey data products as a result of spatial reductions in survey coverage along the US East Coast. The project scope, objectives, and anticipated outcomes and products can be found on the Scope page of this section.\n\n\nFunding and Partnerships\nSSEEP is a collaboration between the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth SMAST, NOAA NEFSC, BOEM, and Fishery Applications Consulting Team (Fishery Apps). Funding for the UMass Dartmouth SMAST project Principal Investigator (PI) and staff is supported by a NOAA NEFSC award to the Cooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region (CINAR). The Project Team is supported by a Steering Committee, and additional partners from NOAA Fisheries, and continued engagement with stakeholders representing wind and fishery science, management, and industry. More information on SSEEP engagement can be found on the Workshop 1 and Workshop 2 page of the Stakeholder Workshop section."

    "text": "_quarto.yml\nLet’s have a closer look at the _quarto.yml file.\nThis type of file (.yml or .yaml) is written in YAML (“Yet Another Markup Language”). You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example. As you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Guided by a series of stakeholder workshops, and collaboration with our Steering Committee and NEFSC’s Offshore Wind Working Group, SSEEP will build from existing spatial analyses to parameterize a spatial observation model for a key set of groundfish species. Simulation testing based off the parameterization and scenarios of interest from the stakeholder workshops, will quantify the performance of potential alternatives for and changes to the statistical survey design of the Bottom Trawl Surveys, complementary sampling, and/or additional survey technologies. The performance of these alternatives will be compared to the traditional random stratified trawl survey design in order to identify which strategies can mitigate or address the impacts of offshore wind development. The spatial simulation modeling framework developed through this project can be generalized to other geographies and other applications of spatial overlaps in multi-use living marine resource management.\nThe intent of these analyses is to understand the effects of changes to scientific monitoring and the monitoring data used support management advice and knowledge of ecosystem status as a result of increases in ocean use. Additionally, the project aims to provide a framework for testing how scientific monitoring can adapt to meet both current and future anticipated needs as well as a framework for coordinated, integrative approaches to ecosystem-based management of marine and fishery systems to support best available science.\n\nObjectives\n(1) Host stakeholder workshops aimed at understanding and prioritizing research questions for the simulation exercise to answer, such as alternatives for survey design and statistical performance measures, and to define a list of scenarios for the mechanisms underlying change (e.g. species productivity and distribution) that will form the focus of simulation evaluation.\n(2) Synthesize and perform statistical analyses of the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey and its spatial overlap with wind areas to parameterize an observation model.\n(3) Develop and parameterize a spatially-explicit model simulator framework that is capable of mirroring historical, observational data from the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Surveys and other potentially supplemental monitoring methods for a key set of groundfish species.\n(4) Conduct simulation testing to evaluate the statistical performance of a stakeholder-based set of plausible alternatives for survey design given a set of ecosystem scenarios, and quantify their resulting uncertainty on key data streams used in fishery stock assessment.\n\n\nAnticipated Project Deliverables\nThe project aims to produce and deliver\n\nGuidance for changes to monitoring strategies and their likely consequences in terms of maintaining monitoring data integrity;\nRankings to prioritize changes to survey designs and strategies based on the expected changes for different scenarios and statistical performance;\nDescriptions of desired statistical properties for supplemental sampling strategies to mitigate displacement of bottom trawl surveys from wind farm areas to inform potential new monitoring approaches (e.g., what sorts of data, what level of sampling effort and precision);\nMinimum requirements for integrating different sampling methods with heterogeneous environmental surveys that are associated with different spatial processes;\nA list of expected scenarios (species, or species distribution drivers) which might be most likely to be at risk; and\nLikely implications of changes to survey sampling for scientific advice (e.g., relative impact on uncertainty in assessments), that can be quantified using Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE).\n\nWhile the initial implementation will be focused on groundfish in the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey, the modeling framework developed for this project will be written in an open, general approach such that it can be applied to other instances of multiple ocean use management/overlap as well as to different geographies. The project will also provide training in quantitative fisheries science, and in collaborative and participatory model building to graduate students and early career scientific staff at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth."
