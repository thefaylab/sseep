### **Project Scope**

SSEEP will use a participatory design approach to develop and apply a spatial observation simulation model framework to understand the implications of changes to fishery independent surveys on the US Northeast Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem as a result of spatial overlap with offshore renewable wind energy installations. Our simulator will emulate key attributes of the Northeast US Bottom Trawl Survey to evaluate the efficacy and statistical properties of changes to survey design and also assess the performance of alternative methods for monitoring groundfish distribution, abundance, and trends.

Guided by a series of stakeholder workshops and collaboration with our Steering Committee and NOAA NEFSC's offshore wind Work Group, SSEEP will build from existing spatial analyses to develop and apply a spatial model framework that can be used in simulation testing to understand the performance of various alternatives for the statistical design of Northeast Bottom Trawl Surveys and complementary sampling, given parameterization of the observation model for a key set of groundfish species.

We will develop a spatial simulation model framework that can be generalized to other geographies
and other applications of spatial overlaps in multi-use living marine resource management. We will use our model framework to conduct simulation testing experiments to understand the statistical performance of changes to survey designs given the scenarios of interest from the stakeholder workshops, and to understand the extent to which the augmentation of fishery independent monitoring with additional survey technologies can mitigate or address the impacts of changes to the traditional random stratified trawl survey design.

The intent of these analyses is to understand the effects of changes in scientific monitoring as a result of increases in ocean use on the data used to support management advice and knowledge of ecosystem status as well as providing a framework for testing how scientific monitoring can adapt to meet both current and future anticipated needs as part of coordinated, integrative approaches to ecosystem-based management of marine and fishery systems while continuing to support best available science.

### Project Organization

SSEEP is a collaboration between University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Fishery Applications Consuling Team. Funding for the UMass Dartmouth SMAST project PI and staff is supported by a NOAA NEFSC award to the Cooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region (CINAR). The **Project Team** is supported by a Steering Committee, and through continued engagement with additional partners at NOAA FIsheries as well as stakeholders representing wind and fishery science, management, and industry (see stakeholder workshop section for more information on SSEEP engagement).

### **Background**

When considering multiple use management effects on fisheries (e.g., from infrastructure siting for other marine use sectors), there is a need to not only understand space use effects, but also how impacts to monitoring from spatial changes propagate through to scientific uncertainty in fisheries governance. Changes to the availability of fishery habitat to both fishery independent surveys and fishery dependent data may influence uncertainty associated with data that are key input to stock assessments that provide catch advice. Under current fisheries governance, this increased uncertainty in stock status estimation may result in more precautionary scientific advice (lower quotas) as managers attempt to mitigate risk. Quantifying the effects of this uncertainty in scientific monitoring for fisheries performance is a critical
step in understanding system effects of multiple ocean uses, and will help quantify the value and costs associated with alternative monitoring required to mitigate this uncertainty to sustain integrity of data streams for fisheries assessment and management.

Planned offshore wind development in the Northeast US and Mid-Atlantic overlaps extensively with the NMFS Bottom Trawl Survey footprints, which have been conducted annually since the 1960s and form the basis of fishery independent data used in stock assessments for commercial and recreationally important fisheries. Based on reviews by BOEM and NMFS, it is likely that bottom trawling will not be able to take place near wind sites, meaning a reduction in resource survey footprints which will interact non-randomly with species distribution and/or life history. Without changes to survey design or consideration of the effects of these changes to the survey footprint, and the evaluation of supplemental monitoring, these changes will diminish the accuracy and representativeness of data the surveys produce and consequently the accuracy downstream of stock assessment models and stock status determinations.

SSEEP will conduct a series of stakeholder workshops to guide development of a spatial observation
simulation model for the Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey that is capable of evaluating the efficacy and statistical properties of changes to survey design and also assess the performance of alternative methods for monitoring groundfish distribution, abundance, and trends. The simulator will be applied to evaluate expected changes in survey data products that will result from spatial reductions in scientific survey coverage due to proposed wind energy installations along the US East Coast, and to assess the
efficacy of supplemental monitoring efforts.

### SSEEP Objectives

**(1) Conduct and facilitate stakeholder workshops** aimed at understanding the questions most of
interest for the simulation exercise to answer, including the alternatives for survey design and statistical performance measures, and to define a list of scenarios for the mechanisms underlying change (species productivity, distribution) that will form the focus of simulation evaluation.

**(2) Synthesize and perform statistical analyses** of the Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey and spatial
overlap with wind areas to parameterize an observation model.

**(3) Develop and parameterize a spatially explicit model simulator framework** that is capable of emulating observational data from the Northeast Bottom Trawl Surveys and supplemental monitoring methods for a key set of groundfish species

**(4) Conduct simulation testing** to evaluate the statistical performance of a stakeholder-based set of plausible alternatives for survey design given a set of ecosystem scenarios and quantify their resulting uncertainty on key data streams used in fishery stock assessment

### Project Timeline

**Year 1 (2021-2022)**

-   Stakeholder workshops to identify research questions and scenarios for simulation evaluations

-   Synthesis and statistical analysis of Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey data and spatial overlap with wind areas to parameterize an observation model

-   Develop a spatially explicit model simulator framework capable of emulating observational data from the Northeast Bottom Trawl Surveys and supplemental monitoring methods (continued in year 2)

**Year 2 (2022 -2023)**

-   Parameterize simulator framework for key set of managed fish species

-   Simulation testing to evaluate performance of plausible alternatives for survey design given a set of ecosystem scenarios

-   Quantify resulting uncertainty on key data streams used in fishery stock assessment

### Anticipated Project Outcomes

-   Paths forward for changes to monitoring strategies and their likely consequences in terms of maintaining monitoring data integrity

-   Relative ranking for prioritizing changes to survey designs and strategies based on the expected changes for different scenarios and statistical performance

-   Description of desired statistical properties for supplemental sampling strategies to mitigate displacement of bottom trawl survey from wind farm areas, to inform potential new monitoring approaches (e.g., what sorts of data, what level of sampling effort and precision)

-   Good enough practices and methods for integrating different sampling methods with heterogeneous environmental surveys that are associated with different spatial processes

-   Which expected scenarios (species, or species distribution drivers) might be most likely to be at risk

-   Likely implications of changes to survey sampling for scientific advice (e.g., relative impact on uncertainty in assessments), that can be quantified using Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE).

While the initial implementation will be focused on groundfish in the Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey, the model framework developed for this project will be written in an open, general approach such that it can
be applied to other instances of multiple ocean use management/overlap, and also in different geographies. The project will also provide training in quantitative fisheries science and collaborative/participatory model building to graduate students and early career scientific staff at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.
