### **Background**

When considering multiple use management effects on fisheries (e.g., from infrastructure siting for other marine use sectors), there is a need to not only understand space use effects, but also how impacts to monitoring from spatial changes propagate through to scientific uncertainty in fisheries governance. Changes to the availability of fishery habitat to both fishery independent surveys and fishery dependent data may influence uncertainty associated with data that are key input to stock assessments that provide catch advice. Under current fisheries governance, this increased uncertainty in stock status estimation may result in more precautionary scientific advice (lower quotas) as managers attempt to mitigate risk. Quantifying the effects of this uncertainty in scientific monitoring for fisheries performance is a critical
step in understanding system effects of multiple ocean uses, and will help quantify the value and costs associated with alternative monitoring required to mitigate this uncertainty to sustain integrity of data streams for fisheries assessment and management.

Planned offshore wind development in the Northeast US and Mid-Atlantic overlaps extensively with the NMFS Bottom Trawl Survey footprints, which have been conducted annually since the 1960s and form the basis of fishery independent data used in stock assessments for commercial and recreationally important fisheries. Based on reviews by BOEM and NMFS, it is likely that bottom trawling will not be able to take place near wind sites, meaning a reduction in resource survey footprints which will interact non-randomly with species distribution and/or life history. Without changes to survey design or consideration of the effects of these changes to the survey footprint, and the evaluation of supplemental monitoring, these changes will diminish the accuracy and representativeness of data the surveys produce and consequently the accuracy downstream of stock assessment models and stock status determinations.

SSEEP will conduct a series of stakeholder workshops to guide development of a spatial observation
simulation model for the Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey that is capable of evaluating the efficacy and statistical properties of changes to survey design and also assess the performance of alternative methods for monitoring groundfish distribution, abundance, and trends. The simulator will be applied to evaluate expected changes in survey data products that will result from spatial reductions in scientific survey coverage due to proposed wind energy installations along the US East Coast, and to assess the
efficacy of supplemental monitoring efforts.

### Project Organization

SSEEP is a collaboration between University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Fishery Applications Consulting Team. Funding for the UMass Dartmouth SMAST project PI and staff is supported by a NOAA NEFSC award to the Cooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region (CINAR). The **Project Team** is supported by a Steering Committee, and through continued engagement with additional partners at NOAA Fisheries as well as stakeholders representing wind and fishery science, management, and industry (see stakeholder workshop section for more information on SSEEP engagement).
