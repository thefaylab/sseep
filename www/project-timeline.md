title: Project Timeline
---

**Year 1 (2021-2022)**

-   Stakeholder workshops to identify research questions and scenarios for simulation evaluations

-   Synthesis and statistical analysis of Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey data and spatial overlap with wind areas to parameterize an observation model

-   Develop a spatially explicit model simulator framework capable of emulating observational data from the Northeast Bottom Trawl Surveys and supplemental monitoring methods (continued in year 2)

**Year 2 (2022 -2023)**

-   Parameterize simulator framework for key set of managed fish species

-   Simulation testing to evaluate performance of plausible alternatives for survey design given a set of ecosystem scenarios

-   Quantify resulting uncertainty on key data streams used in fishery stock assessment
