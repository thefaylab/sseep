#### **Year 1 (2021-2022)**

-   Stakeholder workshops to identify research questions and scenarios for simulation evaluations

    -   [January 20-21, 2022: Workshop One](workshop_1.md)
    -   [February 17-18, 2022: Workshop Two](workshop_2.md)

-   Synthesis and statistical analysis of Northeast Bottom Trawl Survey data and spatial overlap with wind areas to parameterize an observation model

-   Development of a spatially-explicit model simulator framework capable of mirroring historical, observational data from the Northeast Bottom Trawl Surveys and other potentially supplemental monitoring methods (continued in year 2)

#### **Year 2 (2022-2023)**

-   Parameterization of the simulator framework for a key set of managed groundfish species

-   Simulation testing to evaluate the performance of plausible alternatives for survey design given a set of ecosystem scenarios

-   Measurements of resulting uncertainty on key data streams used in fishery stock assessment
