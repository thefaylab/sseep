## Visualization and Modeling Tools

Tools developed during the SSEEP project

### ArcGIS dashboard
To Come: link to the dashboard of survey data and overlap with wind areas developed for Year 1 stakeholder workshops.

### learnr modeling demonstration
This was a model demonstration created for stakeholder workshop #2 to provide an overview of how the general simulation framework could be applied. This is a curated example and is not intended to represent the SSEEP outcomes, rather as a knowledge-building tool for developing understanding about how the model could work and the types of information that could be represented.
