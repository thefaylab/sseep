title: Workshop One (January 20-21, 2022)
---

The first SSEEP stakeholder workshop was held remotely January 20-21 of 2022 via Zoom, and was originally postponed from its October 2021 date due to inclement weather causing internet and power outages for many workshop facilitators and attendees. The workshop was facilitated by Dr. Cate O'Keefe (Fishery Apps), with content for the process agenda developed by various members of the SSEEP project team. Additional plenary facilitation support was provided by Dr. Gavin Fay (UMassD-SMAST). The workshop was aimed at understanding the questions most of interest for the simulation exercise to answer, including the alternatives for survey design and statistical performance measures.

### Terms of Reference

The project team, along with input from the Steering Committee, drafted terms of reference (TORs) to direct the modeling and analytical framework for the project, as well as to facilitate breakout discussions throughout the first workshop.

1.  **Identify and describe the effects and impacts from offshore wind energy development on the Northeast Fisheries Science Center Bottom Trawl Survey and the survey's data products**.

    *This TOR will include, but not be limited to, the following:*

    -   Impacts on survey design, methods, implementation, and performance.

    -   Impacts on survey data products used to support scientific advice for management of fishery and ecosystem resources.

    -   Define key research questions that need to be answered by a simulation modeling study.

2.  **Identify and prioritize methods and approaches to analyze impacts on the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey performance and the provision of scientific advice.**

    *This TOR will include, but not be limited to, the following*

    -   Identify aspects of a simulation modeling framework needed to support key research questions

        1.  Data needs

        2.  Features of a model to support alternative survey design

        3.  Features of a model to support continued survey data products

    -   Identify methods to analyze and evaluate potential survey adaptation approaches to mitigate the impacts to survey monitoring operations

    -   Identify additional technical expertise or gaps in information needed to support simulation design for testing NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey mitigation
