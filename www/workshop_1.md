*Workshop report \[coming soon\]*

### Terms of Reference

1.  **Identify and describe the effects and impacts from offshore wind energy development on the Northeast Fisheries Science Center Bottom Trawl Survey and the survey's data products**.

    *This TOR will include, but not be limited to, the following:*

    -   Impacts on survey design, methods, implementation, and performance.

    -   Impacts on survey data products used to support scientific advice for management of fishery and ecosystem resources.

    -   Define key research questions that need to be answered by a simulation modeling study.

2.  **Identify and prioritize methods and approaches to analyze impacts on the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey performance and the provision of scientific advice.**

    *This TOR will include, but not be limited to, the following*

    -   Identify aspects of a simulation modeling framework needed to support key research questions

        1.  Data needs

        2.  Features of a model to support alternative survey design

        3.  Features of a model to support continued survey data products

    -   Identify methods to analyze and evaluate potential survey adaptation approaches to mitigate the impacts to survey monitoring operations

    -   Identify additional technical expertise or gaps in information needed to support simulation design for testing NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey mitigation
