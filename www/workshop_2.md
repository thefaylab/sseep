title: Workshop Two (February 17-18, 2022)
---

The second SSEEP stakeholder workshop, held via Zoom in February 2022 focused on first reviewing a synthesis of workshop 1 results, and then discussions on the scenarios that the simulation framework would be used to assess.

The workshop was facilitated by Dr. Cate O'Keefe (Fishery Apps).

*Workshop report \[coming soon\]*

### Terms of Reference

1.  **Review the prioritized methods and approaches for simulation study design.**

    *This TOR will include, but not be limited to, the following:*

    -   Results from SSEEP Stakeholder Workshop #1

    -   Features of the operating model to:

        1.  Represent sampled fish populations

        2.  Support alternative survey designs and supplemental sampling methods

        3.  Represent different data products of interest

2.  **Define and describe a list of scenarios for mechanisms underlying change that will form the focus of the simulation evaluation. including: a) Ecosystem change; b) Survey and sampling change**

    *This TOR will include, but not be limited to, the following:*

    -   Ecosystem Change

        1.  Key species of interests

        2.  Species productivity and distribution changes

    -   Survey and sampling change

        1.  In response to offshore wind energy development (turbines, cables)

        2.  As a result of other system drivers

        3.  Availability of resources for supplemental sampling

3.  **Identify a set of performance metrics that will be used to compare the performance of alternatives for the defined scenarios.**
