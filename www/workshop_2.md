title: Workshop Two (February 17-18, 2022)
---

The second SSEEP stakeholder workshop was held remotely February 17-18 of 2022 via Zoom, and was postponed from its original date to provide appropriate time after [Workshop One](workshop_1.md). The workshop was facilitated by Dr. Cate O'Keefe (Fishery Apps), with content for the process agenda developed by various members of the SSEEP project team. Additional plenary facilitation support was provided by Dr. Gavin Fay (UMassD-SMAST). The workshop focused on first reviewing a synthesis of Workshop One results, and then defining a set of scenarios for the mechanisms underlying change (species productivity, distribution) that the simulation framework would be used to assess.

### Terms of Reference

The project team, along with input from the Steering Committee, drafted terms of reference (TORs) to direct the modeling and analytical framework for the project, as well as to facilitate breakout discussions throughout the second stakeholder workshop.

1.  **Review the prioritized methods and approaches for simulation study design.**

    *This TOR will include, but not be limited to, the following:*

    -   Results from SSEEP Stakeholder Workshop #1

    -   Features of the operating model to:

        1.  Represent sampled fish populations

        2.  Support alternative survey designs and supplemental sampling methods

        3.  Represent different data products of interest

2.  **Define and describe a list of scenarios for mechanisms underlying change that will form the focus of the simulation evaluation. including: a) Ecosystem change; b) Survey and sampling change**

    *This TOR will include, but not be limited to, the following:*

    -   Ecosystem Change

        1.  Key species of interests

        2.  Species productivity and distribution changes

    -   Survey and sampling change

        1.  In response to offshore wind energy development (turbines, cables)

        2.  As a result of other system drivers

        3.  Availability of resources for supplemental sampling

3.  **Identify a set of performance metrics that will be used to compare the performance of alternatives for the defined scenarios.**
